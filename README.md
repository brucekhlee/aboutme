I am currently a staff scientist at NIDA/NIH. My group uses GitHub Enterprise, and many of our repositories are private. The following links are for publicly released repositories:


### ligand-based 
- Machine learning-based QSAR modeling for [DAT-hERG](https://github.com/NIDA-IRP-CCMB/QSAR_DAT-hERG/tree/master/QSAR_DAT-hERG)<br>
The results are published in JCIM: '[Toward Reducing hERG Affinities for DAT Inhibitors with a Combined Machine Learning and Molecular Modeling Approach](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00856)'. In the [DAT-hERG](https://github.com/NIDA-IRP-CCMB/QSAR_DAT-hERG/tree/master/QSAR_DAT-hERG) repository, our initial instructions were built here, and now we have expanded its functionality further. These additions are not in the public domain.


### structure-based
Strucutral anaylses and MD simulation for aminergric family GPCR

- [aminergic_receptors_2023-03](https://github.com/NIDA-IRP-CCMB/analysis_ACC/blob/master/aminergic_receptors_2023-03/README.md) <br>
The results are published in JCIM: '[A novel “activation switch” motif common to all aminergic receptors](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00732)'.

- [dopamine_D2_D3_receptors_2023-03](https://github.com/NIDA-IRP-CCMB/analysis_ACC/blob/master/dopamine_D2_D3_receptors_2023-03/README.md) <br>
The results are published in JCIM: '[Unraveling Activation-Related Rearrangements and Intrinsic Divergence from Ligand-Specific Conformational Changes of the Dopamine D3 and D2 Receptors](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01956)'.
